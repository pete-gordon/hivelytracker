<h1>HivelyTracker v1.9 from IRIS & Up Rough!</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
HivelyTracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in the mid '90s
by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively popular, and many songs were
created and used in scene productions and games. AHX was designed to create a very
SID-like sound on the Amiga.
</p>
<p>
Once I had upgraded to an AmigaOne XE running OS4, I wanted to use it to create AHX
tunes, but unfortunately, the AHX tracker was too heavily reliant on the classic
Amiga hardware to run directly without using UAE. I decided to try and write my own
editor for the AHX format, and that eventually evolved into HivelyTracker.
</p>
<p>
HivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX format, but it
also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has its own instrument and module
formats. HivelyTracker offers the following features over AHX:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Multichannel (4 to 16 channels)</li>
<li>Per-channel stereo panning</li>
<li>Two commands per note instead of one</li>
<li>Ring modulation</li>
<li>A more feature rich editor</li>
</ul>
